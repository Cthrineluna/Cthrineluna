### 💡 About Me

Hi! I'm Catherine, a passionate **UI/UX Designer** with a love for creating meaningful and accessible digital experiences. I specialize in transforming complex ideas into clean, user-centered interfaces that feel natural and intuitive.

With a background in design and a growing interest in frontend development, I bridge the gap between **form** and **function**—ensuring every product I work on is both beautiful and usable.

> I believe design is not just how it looks, but how it works and how it feels.

When I'm not designing, you’ll find me enjoying iced coffee, watching movies, and sketching wireframes✍️.
