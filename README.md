### 💡 About Me

Hi! I'm Catherine, a passionate **UI/UX Designer** with a love for creating meaningful and accessible digital experiences. I specialize in transforming complex ideas into clean, user-centered interfaces that feel natural and intuitive.

With a background in design and a growing interest in frontend development, I bridge the gap between **form** and **function**—ensuring every product I work on is both beautiful and usable.

> I believe design is not just how it looks, but how it works — and how it feels.

When I'm not designing, you’ll find me curating mood boards on Pinterest, enjoying iced coffee ☕, or sketching wireframes in my notebook ✍️.
